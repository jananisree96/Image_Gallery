# Image Gallery with Flexbox Layout
This HTML document presents a visually appealing image gallery, combining HTML and CSS for a seamless and responsive design. Below is a concise description of the key components:

# HTML Structure
The HTML file starts with a standard document type declaration, specifying the language as English. Meta tags for character set and viewport settings are included, ensuring compatibility across devices. The page is titled "Image Gallery," and external fonts from Google's API (Ubuntu font in various weights) are linked for a polished appearance.

# Styling
The external stylesheet, "style.css," is linked to enhance the visual presentation and maintain a clean structure.

# Content Structure
The primary content is wrapped within a div element, featuring a prominent title "Image Gallery" (styled using the 'title' class). The image gallery itself is organized using a flex container ('container' class), allowing for a flexible and responsive layout.

# Image Sections
Each image section consists of an image sourced dynamically from Unsplash (200x200 pixels, related to flowers), a title (e.g., "Image 1"), and a brief description using placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum). The content is neatly organized within individual div elements.

# Flexbox Layout
The use of Flexbox ensures an adaptive and visually pleasing arrangement of images, allowing the gallery to seamlessly adjust to different screen sizes.
